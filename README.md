# Luke's Portfolio

## This is my portfolio which contains information about me and projects I've done.

## I've added three buttons on the navbar that take you to the My Work section, About Me section, and the Contact Me seciton.

## I've created and added image for the background of the hero and added my name and title to the hero.

## I've made an About Me section which displays an image of myself and a short bio.
